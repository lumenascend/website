        At the heart of great design is solving real problems - whether it's a business obstacle, user frustration, or a gap in the market. Our "Design Generation" service focuses on creating user-focused solutions that are not only functional but intuitive and valuable.      </p>

    <p class="pb-4">Design generation refers to the use of AI-powered or rule-based tools to automatically create or suggest user interface layouts, components, and design systems based on user needs, content, or business goals. Instead of building screens from scratch, designers can input basic requirements—like a user flow, brand guidelines, or key features—and the system generates design mockups or wireframes that follow best practices for usability and accessibility. This speeds up the ideation process, supports rapid prototyping, and helps maintain consistency across digital products. Tools like Figma (with plugins like Autoname or Magician) and Framer are increasingly integrating generative capabilities, allowing designers to focus more on strategy and user empathy while letting automation handle repetitive layout and styling tasks.</p>
